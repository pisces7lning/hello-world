Hello!

My name is Kookie, and I am pure Persian cat with mixutre black and white long coat hair.  I am 10 years old, and hopefully I will live another 15 years since my human told me that I have a very good gene for long lifttime.  My human gave birth to a baby human and I took the responsiblity to look after for him. He is a cute baby.  This duty is kind of stress me out, so I started scratch myself and I have bald spot right above my eyelid.  My human sent me to one of her friend's house to let me have a vacation.  I like my human's friend, she feeds me chicken and QUAIL! I also like to play hide and seek with her.  Now I am back with my human and I am kind of missing her.
